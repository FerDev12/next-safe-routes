description: Installation guide for our next-safe-routes.
---

To get started with next-safe-routes, follow these simple steps:

## Prerequisites

Before installing our application, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- A Next.js application

<Note title='Supported Versions' type='info'>
  <code>next-safe-routes</code> currently only supports Next.js versions >=
  13.0.0 "app" router
</Note>

## Installation Steps

<Stepper>
<StepperItem title="Clone the Repository">
Create a Next.js app

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

</StepperItem>
<StepperItem title="Install Next Safe routes">
```bash
npm install next-safe-routes
```

</StepperItem>

<StepperItem title="Create your project's Routes type">
To create the Routes type you can either use the cli tool or the Next.js pluggin.

## CLI

```bash
npm run generate-routes
```

## Plugin

```js
import { withNextSafeRoutes } from 'next-safe-routes/plugin';

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = withNextSafeRoutes({
  // The rest of your next.config.
});

export default nextConfig;
```

```bash
npm run build
# or
npm run dev
```

<Note title='Turborepo Support' type='warning'>
  <code>next-safe-routes</code> currently does not support the use of Turborepo.
  If you are using Turborepo for development consider running the CLI command
  before starting your server.
</Note>

</StepperItem>

<StepperItem title='Create your navigation helpers'>
We recommend creating a navigation.ts file in your src directory.

```ts
import { createNextSafeNavigation } from 'next-safe-routes';
// Import the generated Routes type
import { Routes } from './types/routes';

export const { getRoute, Link, useRouter, redirect } =
  createNextSafeNavigation<Routes>();
```

</StepperItem>

</Stepper>

### And that's it! You can now use your navigation utils wherever you would use Next.js's native routing utilities.
