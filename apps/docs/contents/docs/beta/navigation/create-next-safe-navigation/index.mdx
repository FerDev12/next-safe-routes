description: Learn how to create all your routing utils with createNextSafeNavigation
---

## Basic Usage

We recommend creating and exporting your routing utilities in a file called navigation.ts at the root of your src directory, although you can name it and place it wherever you prefer.

```ts
// navigation.ts

import { createNextSafeNavigation } from 'next-safe-routes';
import { Routes } from './types/routes';

export const { getRoute, Link, useRouter, redirect } =
  createNextSafeNavigation<Routes>();
```

This setup creates four main routing utilities:

- `getRoute`: A function to generate type-safe route strings
- `Link`: A type-safe wrapper around Next.js's `Link` component
- `useRouter`: A hook providing type-safe routing methods
- `redirect`: A type-safe server-side redirect function

## The Routes Type Parameter

The `Routes` type parameter is optional but highly recommended to provide type safety for each route in your application. This type is typically generated automatically based on your project's file structure.

See [generate routes](/beta/docs/generate-routes) for more information about generating your projects Routes type.

## Type Safety Benefits

When you provide the `Routes` type to `createNextSafeNavigation`, you get several benefits:

1. **Route Validation**: Ensures that you're only using routes that actually exist in your application.
2. **Parameter Type Checking**: Verifies that all required parameters are provided and are of the correct type.
3. **Autocompletion**: Your IDE can provide autocompletion for route paths and parameter names.

## What Happens If I Omit the Routes Type?

If you omit the `Routes` type, you lose full type safety. Without the generated `Routes` type, your navigation utilities will have no information to infer your routes at compile time.

However, even without the `Routes` type, Next Safe Routes still provides some safety features at runtime:

```ts
import { createNextSafeNavigation } from 'next-safe-routes';

// Omit Routes type
const { getRoute, ...otherUtilities } = createNextSafeNavigation();

// This will throw a runtime error: "Missing required parameter: ${paramName}"
getRoute('/products/[productId]');
```

In this example, we've entered a route that requires a dynamic parameter "productId", but we've omitted passing it in the `pathConfig` argument. This will throw a runtime error indicating that the parameter is required.

While this runtime check is helpful, it's not as powerful as the compile-time checks you get when using the `Routes` type. With the `Routes` type, this error would be caught at compile time, preventing the issue before your code even runs.

## Best Practices

1. **Always use the Routes type**: Generate and use the `Routes` type to get the full benefits of Next Safe Routes.
2. **Keep Routes type updated**: Regenerate your `Routes` type whenever you add or modify routes in your application.
3. **Use in a central location**: Create your navigation utilities in a central file and import them throughout your application for consistent usage.
4. **Leverage autocompletion**: Take advantage of the autocompletion provided by your IDE to explore available routes and parameters.

By using `createNextSafeNavigation` with a generated `Routes` type, you can ensure type-safe routing throughout your Next.js application, catching potential errors at compile-time and improving overall code quality and developer experience.
