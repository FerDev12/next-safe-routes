description: Learn how to create all your routing utils with createNextSafeNavigation
---

We recommend creating and exporting your routing utilities in a file called navigation.ts at the root of your src directory. Althoug you can name it and place it wherever you want.

```ts
// navigation.ts

import { createNextSafeNavigation } from 'next-safe-routes';
import { Routes } from './types/routes';

export const { getRoute, Link, useRouter, redirect } =
  createNextSafeNavigation<Routes>();
```

The Routes type parameter is optional but highly recommended to provide type-safety for each route of your application.

See [generate routes](/beta/docs/generate-routes) for more information about generating your projects Routes type.

## What happens if I ommit the Routes type?

The answer is that you loose type-safety. Without the generated Routes type your navigation utilities will have no information to infer your routes.

On the bright side it will still provide some safety-features:

```ts
import { createNextSafeNavigation } from 'next-safe-routes';

// Omit Routes type
const { getRoute, ...otherUtilities } = createNextSafeNavigation();

// This will throw a runtime error: "Missing required parameter: ${paramName}"
getRoute('/products/[productId]');
```

On the example above we entered a route that takes in the dynamic parameter "productId" but we omitted passing it in the pathConfig argument. This will throw an error indicating that the parameter is required.
