title: useRouter
description: The `useRouter` hook is a type-safe extension of Next.js's native `useRouter` hook. It provides all the functionality of the original hook, but with added type safety for your application's routes.
---

<Note title='Environment' type='warning'>
  This hook is intended for client components only. If you require server-side
  navigation consider using [redirect](/docs/beta/navigation/redirect).
</Note>

```tsx
'use client';

import { useRouter } from './navigation.ts';

export function Component() {
  const router = useRouter();

  const onClick = () => {
    router.push('/products/[productId]', {
      params: {
        productId: '123',
      },
      query: {
        foo: 'bar',
      },
    });
  };

  return <button onClick={onClick}>Go to Product</button>;
}
```

In this example, `useRouter` is used to navigate to a product page with a specific ID and query parameter.

## Key Features

1. **Type-Safe Navigation**: The `push`, `replace`, and `prefetch` methods are type-safe, ensuring that you're using valid routes and providing the correct parameters.
2. **Autocomplete Support**: Enjoy IDE autocomplete for your routes, params, and query parameters.
3. **Compile-Time Checks**: Catch routing errors during development instead of at runtime.
4. **Familiar API**: If you're familiar with Next.js's `useRouter`, you'll feel right at home with this enhanced version.
5. **Keep Routes Updated**: Ensure your Routes type is up-to-date with your actual application 5.routes for the best type-safety experience.

## Example in Action

Here's a visual representation of `useRouter` in action that demonstrates how `useRouter` provides autocompletion and type checking as you type, helping to prevent errors and improve developer productivity:

By using the `useRouter` hook from Next Safe Routes, you can ensure type-safe client-side navigation throughout your Next.js application, improving code quality and developer experience.
