title: getRoute
description: The `getRoute` function is the cornerstone of Next Safe Routes, providing type-safe route generation for your Next.js application. It's used internally by all other navigation utilities created by [`createNextSafeNavigation`](/docs/navigation/create-next-safe-navigation), but can also be used standalone for maximum flexibility.
---

```ts
imort { getRoute } from '../navigation.ts'

const route = getRoute('/products/[productId]', {
  params: {
    productId: 123
  },
  query: {
    foo: 'bar'
  }
})

console.log(route) // route === /products/123?foo=bar
```

In this example, `getRoute` takes a route pattern and an options object, then returns the final parsed route as a string.

<Note title='Environment' type='info'>
  getRoute can be used in any place within your Next app including server
  components, client components, API routes, middleware and serve actions.
</Note>

## Advanced Usage

`getRoute` serves as an escape hatch when you need more control over route generation. You can use it to generate type-safe routes and then use them with any navigation method you prefer:

```tsx
'use client'

import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
import { getRoute } from './navigation.ts'

export function Component() {
  const router = useRouter()

  const handleClick = () => {
    // Generate your type-safe route with getRoute
    const route = getRoute('/products/[productId], {
      params: {
        productId: '123'
      }
    })

    // Using our generated route with Next.js native router
    router.prefetch(route)
    // Some async logic...
    router.push(route)
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>
    Navigate to route
  </button>
}
```

This approach allows you to leverage the type safety of `getRoute` while still using Next.js's native routing methods

## Type Safety

One of the key benefits of `getRoute` is its type safety. It will catch errors at compile-time if you try to use a non-existent route, miss a required parameter, or provide an incorrect parameter type.

```ts
// This will cause a TypeScript error if '/products/[productId]' is not a valid route
// or if 'productId' is not of the correct type
const route = getRoute('/products/[productId]', {
  params: {
    productId: 123,
  },
});
```

## Example in Action

Here's a visual representation of `getRoute` in action that demonstrates how `getRoute` provides autocompletion and type checking as you type, helping to prevent errors and improve developer productivity:

## Best Practices

1. **Use with TypeScript**: While `getRoute` works with JavaScript, you get the most benefit when using TypeScript, as it enables full type checking.
2. **Keep your Routes type up to date**: Remember to regenerate your Routes type whenever you add or modify routes in your application.
3. **Use with other Next Safe Routes utilities**: While `getRoute` can be used standalone, it's often most powerful when used in conjunction with other Next Safe Routes utilities like `Link`, `useRouter`, and `redirect`.

By leveraging `getRoute`, you can ensure type-safe route generation throughout your Next.js application, catching potential errors early and improving overall code quality.
