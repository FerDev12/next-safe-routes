title: redirect
description: The redirect function is a type-safe wrapper around Next.js's native redirect function. It provides the same functionality but with added type checking and autocompletion for your routes.

<Note type='warning' title='Environment'>
  The `redirect` function created by `createNextSafeNavigation` can only be used
  in server components and server actions. For client-side navigation, consider
  using [useRouter](/docs/beta/navigation/use-router) or the
  [Link](/docs/beta/navigation/link) component.
</Note>

Basic Usage
Here's a simple example of how to use the redirect function:

```tsx
import { redirect } fro './navigation.ts'
import { auth } from './auth.ts'

export async function ProfilePage() {
  const { user } = await auth()

  if (!user) {
    return redirect('/auth/sign-in/[[...provider]], {
      params: {
        provider: ['github']
      },
      query: {
        from: 'profile'
      }
    })
  }

  // Rest of the component logic...
  return <div>Welcome {user.name}</div>
}
```

## Example in Action

Here's a visual representation of `redirect` in action that demonstrates how `redirect` provides autocompletion and type checking as you type, helping to prevent errors and improve developer productivity.

## Best Practices

1. **Import from your navigation file**: Always import `redirect` from the file where you called `createNextSafeNavigation`.
2. **Use in server-side code only**: Remember that `redirect` is for server-side use. For client-side navigation, use `useRouter` or `Link`.
3. **Provide all required parameters**: Ensure you're providing all required route parameters to avoid runtime errors.
4. **Keep your Routes type up to date**: Regenerate your Routes type whenever you add or modify routes in your application to ensure `redirect` has the most current route information.

By leveraging the type-safe `redirect` function, you can ensure that your server-side redirects are always targeting valid routes with the correct parameters, catching potential errors at compile-time rather than runtime.
