title: Navigation
description: Next Safe Routes helps you navigate through your app with safety by providing a set of navigation utilities that work with your generated Routes type to create type-safe route inference.

<Note title='Ommitting Routes Type' type='info'>
  While the navigation utilities are meant to work with the Routes type, you can
  choose to omit passing the Routes type parameter when creating your utilities.
  This will not provide any type-safety but it will provide runtime errors if it
  is not capabe of parsing the route data you entered.
