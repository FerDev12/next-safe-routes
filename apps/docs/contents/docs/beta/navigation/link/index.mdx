title: <Link />
description: The Link component in Next Safe Routes is a type-safe extension of Next.js's native Link component. It provides all the functionality of the original component, but with added type safety for your application's routes.
---

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the Link component:

```tsx
import { Link } from './navigation.ts';

export function Component() {
  return (
    <Link
      href={{
        pathname: '/products/[productId]',
        params: { productId: '123' },
        query: { foo: 'bar' },
      }}
    >
      Go to product
    </Link>
  );
}
```

In this example, `Link` is used to create a clickable link to a product page with a specific ID and query parameter.

## Key Features

1. **Type-Safe Navigation**: The `href` prop is type-safe, ensuring that you're using valid routes and providing the correct parameters.
2. **Autocomplete Support**: Enjoy IDE autocomplete for your routes, params, and query parameters.
3. **Compile-Time Checks**: Catch routing errors during development instead of at runtime.
4. **Familiar API**: If you're familiar with Next.js's `Link`, you'll feel right at home with this enhanced version.

## Advanced Usage

The `Link` component from Next Safe Routes extends the functionality of Next.js's native `Link`. Here's an example showcasing more of its features:

```tsx
import { Link } from './navigation';

export function AdvancedNavigation() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link href='/home'>Home</Link>

      <Link
        href={{
          pathname: '/blog/[slug]',
          params: { slug: 'my-first-post' },
          query: { source: 'navbar' },
        }}
        prefetch={false}
      >
        Latest Blog Post
      </Link>

      <Link
        href={{
          pathname: '/products/[category]/[id]',
          params: { category: 'electronics', id: '12345' },
        }}
        replace
      >
        Featured Product
      </Link>

      <Link
        href={{
          pathname: '/search',
          query: { q: 'nextjs', page: '1' },
        }}
        scroll={false}
      >
        Search Results
      </Link>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

This example demonstrates various `Link` props including `prefetch`, `replace`, and `scroll`, along with different ways to specify the `href`.

## Example in Action

Here's a visual representation of the `Link` component in action that demonstrates how the `Link` component provides autocompletion and type checking as you type, helping to prevent errors and improve developer productivity:

## Props

The `Link` component accepts all props from Next.js's native `Link` component, plus some additional type-safe props:

- `href`: An object with `pathname`, `params`, and `query` properties, or a string for simple routes.
- `prefetch`: Boolean to control prefetching behavior (default: `true`).
- `replace`: Boolean to replace the current history entry instead of adding a new one (default: `false`).
- `scroll`: Boolean to control scrolling to the top of the page after navigation (default: `true`).

## Best Practices

1. **Use for Internal Navigation**: Use `Link` for all internal navigation within your Next.js application.
2. **Leverage Type Safety**: Take advantage of the type safety provided by `Link` to catch potential routing errors early in development.
3. **Prefetch Important Routes**: Use the `prefetch` prop for routes that are likely to be navigated to, improving the perceived performance of your application.
4. **Consider SEO**: Use descriptive text within your `Link` components to improve SEO.
5. **Keep Routes Updated**: Ensure your Routes type is up-to-date with your actual application routes for the best type-safety experience.

By using the `Link` component from Next Safe Routes, you can ensure type-safe navigation throughout your Next.js application, improving code quality and developer experience.
